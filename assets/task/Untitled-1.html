        expect tropical rainforests to be located around the world. There are
        also temperate rainforests that have lower average temperatures. South
        America has both temperate and tropical forests in different parts of
        the continent, as shown in the first map below.</span

    The second map shows the average temperature of the oceans around South
    America and the third map shows the prevailing winds over South America and
    the surrounding oceans. Use these maps and what you know about energy
    transfer to answer questions 2a-2c.
