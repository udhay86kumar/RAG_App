    >Hurricanes tend to develop in certain parts of the ocean. They also tend to
    happen only during a certain part of the year (June 1 to November 30), which
    is called hurricane season. The data below show how the water temperature
    and humidity in the air compare in these parts of the ocean during 2 times
    of the year.</span
