A key notes a brown dot is A I, a blue dot is C u, and the three triangles are r x n progress. Before mixing, 2 A I dots and a group of 3 1 S O subscript 4 with 1 C u then have particles break apart from each other and rearrange during the r x n progress to have 2 A I dots combine with 3 S O subscript 4 dots and the 3 C u dots are by themselves. Energy transfer to particles including the salt water in the r x n system into the r x n system. The Temperature increases (particle speed increase). The energy transfers from the R x n system into a box labeled Food System. The temperature decreases (particle speed decrease) through conduction (particle collision) with the Food System (temperature increase, particle speed increase). A key notes three triangles are changes in the arrangement of matter and the arrows are energy transfer."
