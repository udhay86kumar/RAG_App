<p class="noindent">
  Each OpenSciEd unit includes an assessment system that offers many
  opportunities for different types of assessments throughout the lessons,
  including pre-assessment, formative assessment, summative assessment, and
  student self-assessment. Formative assessments are embedded and called out
  directly in the lesson plans. Please look for the &ldquo;Assessment
  Opportunity&rdquo; teacher support boxes to identify places for assessments.
  In addition, the table below outlines where each type of assessment can be
  found in the unit.

          The student work in Lesson 1 available for assessment should be
          considered a pre-assessment. It is an opportunity to learn more about
          the ideas that your students bring to this unit. Revealing these ideas
          early on can help you be more strategic in how to build from and
          leverage student ideas across the unit.
        </p>

        <p class="noindent1-top">
          The initial model developed on day 1 about the
          question&mdash;&ldquo;How does a flameless heater heat up food just by
          adding room-temperature water?&rdquo;&mdash;is a good opportunity to
          pre-assess student understanding of chemical reactions and transfer of
          thermal energy at the particle level. On day 2, students develop an
          initial design solution and compare it with those of classmates, which
          is a good time to pre-assess student understanding of engineering
          design. Also, on day 2 students work together as a class to make
          entries in their Progress Trackers to explain in their own words how
          they have defined the problems with prepackaged MREs, proposed a
          design solution, and listed initial criteria and constraints.
        </p>

        <p class="noindent1-top">
          The Design Questions Board is another opportunity for pre-assessment.
          Encourage students to generate open-ended questions, such as how and
          why questions, to post to the board. Make note of any close-ended
          questions and use navigation time throughout the unit to have your
          students practice turning these questions into open-ended questions as
          they relate to the investigations underway. Students&rsquo; questions
          for the DQB should be connected to the observations that they had
          previously made and be directed at seeking additional information
          about how they could design a device that will heat food without
          electricity or flame (possibly using a chemical process).

          The Progress Tracker is a thinking tool that was designed to help
          students keep track of important discoveries that the class makes
          while investigating phenomena and to figure out how to prioritize and
          use those discoveries to develop a model to explain phenomena. It is
          important that what the students write in the Progress Tracker
          reflects their own thinking at that particular moment in time. In this
          way, the Progress Tracker can be used to formatively assess individual
          student progress or for students to assess their own understanding
          throughout the unit. Because the Progress Tracker is meant to be a
          thinking tool for kids, we strongly suggest that it not be collected
          for a summative &ldquo;grade&rdquo; other than for completion.

          <em>OpenSciEd Teacher Handbook</em> is designed to give you options
          for how to support this in your classroom. It also includes
          student-facing materials to support giving and receiving feedback
          along with self-assessment rubrics through which students can reflect
          on their experience with the process.

          Peer feedback is most useful when there are complex and diverse ideas
          visible in student work and not all work is the same. Student models
          or explanations are good times to use a peer feedback protocol. They
          do not need to be final pieces of student work; rather, peer feedback
          will be more valuable to students if they have time to revise after
          receiving peer feedback. It should be a formative, not summative, type
          of assessment. It is also necessary for students to have experience
          with past investigations, observations, and activities, which they can
          then use as evidence for their feedback.
